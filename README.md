# Systema

Systema is an interactive educational application designed to visualize the layers of computing, from transistors to cloud systems. Through engaging animations and interactive modules, users can explore and understand the fundamental concepts that underpin modern computing.

## Features

- **Interactive Modules**: Each layer of computing is represented as an interactive module, allowing users to engage with the content dynamically.
- **Visualizations**: Animated visualizations help illustrate complex concepts, making learning more intuitive and enjoyable.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Topics include transistors, logic gates, CPU architecture, memory types, operating systems, networking, and cloud computing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/systema.git
